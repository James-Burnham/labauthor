# What Are Azure Restriction Policies?

Azure Restriction Policy is a Lab on Demand platform term. More natively, these are simply "Azure Policies". A restriction policy is used to limit the resources that users can provision on the cloud platform. This helps to prevent additional charges from incurring if students configure something in the Cloud portal that is outside of the scope of the lab. Restriction Policies also help students stay within the goals of the lab.
