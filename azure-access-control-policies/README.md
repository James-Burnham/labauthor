# What Are Azure Access Control Policies?

Azure Access Control Policy is a Lab on Demand platform term. More natively, these are simply "Azure Policies". An access control policy is used to limit the resources that users can provision on the cloud platform. 

For more information, see [Microsoft's Official Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/policy/).

# Why Do I Need an Access Control Policy?
Access Control Policies primary purposes are:
  - To help users stay within the goals of a lab by blocking them from unneeded resources.
  - To prevent additional charges from incurring by blocking users from creating items of a higher cost SKU than needed.
  - To prevent malicious users from abusing a lab for personal gain.
