# What Are Azure Access Control Policies?

Azure Access Control Policy is a Lab on Demand platform term. More natively, these are simply "Azure Policies". An access control policy is used to limit the resources that users can provision on the cloud platform.

# Why Do I Need an Access Control Policy?
Access Control Policies have a variety of uses, such as the following:
  - Help to prevent additional charges from incurring if users configure something that is outside of the scope of the lab.
  - Help students stay within the goals of the lab by blocking them from creating a resource if it doesn't meet the goals.
  - Prevent malicious users from abusing a lab for personal gain.
